# House-Price-Prediction-Project

This is a real dataset of house prices sold in Seattle, Washing, USA between August and December 2022.
The task is to predict the house price in this area based on several features, which are described below.

### Feature Description:

beds: Number of bedrooms in property
baths: Number of bathrooms in property. Note 0.5 corresponds to a half-bath which has a sink and toilet but no tub or shower
size: Total floor area of property
size_units: Units of the previous measurement
lot_size: Total area of the land where the property is located on. The lot belongs to the house owner
lot_size_units: Units of the previous measurement
zip_code: Zip code. This is a postal code used in the USA
price: Price the property was sold for (US dollars)

In this project, I applied the skills from Supervised Learning with scikit-learn to address the given problem by employing various models, optimizing them, and selecting the best-performing model among them to make predictions.
